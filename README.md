## What

flyleaf.js is a components library based on sveltejs.

It's a cross frontend framework component library, that is to say
no matter what you are using in your project, e.g. Vue2/Vue3/React/Angular,
you can use flyleaf's components.

Because a compiled component based on sveltejs is ES class;

## Usage

### install

```javascript
npm install flyleaf
```

### use a component

```javascript
import { ComA } from 'flyleaf';

const com = new ComA({
    target: document.getElementById('app'),
    props: {

    },
})
com.$on('some-event', (evt)={
    console.log('evt: ', evt)
})
```

## Contribute

welcome to Contribute your components and practice svelte syntax by the way.
